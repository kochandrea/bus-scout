# Welcome to the Bus Scout!
A rails application intended to allow users to make reports about transit stops in Chicago.

This is development stage 2 of 2 ([click here](https://github.com/itlyons/civtech-transit-app) for stage 1).

#### Example:
Once a user has searched for a bus stop location, they can view reports provided by other users or add one of their own.  Here's what it looks like when no information has been entered at that bus stop:

A user can click to add a report and fill out the form to notify others.

Once a report has been submitted, the bus stop page is updated with the time of the report, comments, and the ID of the user reporting (which also allows a user/'Scout' to double-check that their report went through).
